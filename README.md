# WEEK 14 HOMEWORK - EAT-DA-BURGER

<p>This week's assignment was to make an app using JavaScript, Node, Express and Handlebars. For this assignment we used the MVC pattern and our own custom ORM for the queries to the database. Once completed, the app should let the user add custom named burgers to the page and also 'eat' burgers that are on the page. When a user creates or eats a burger, it actually interacts with the database, not just the current session.</p>


## CHALLENGES 
* Familiarizing myself with the MVC pattern.
* Getting used to ORM and structuring in that way. (Lost of JavaScript files that are connected)
